# Just Now
# Friends (hint: this is one of the long ones) I want you to know what our team is doing on behalf of our fellow Mississippians.
# ...
# #1 we are not panicking. As we do with every emergency (tornado, hurricane, flooding, ice storm, and this pandemic), we are calmly making decisions based on the best available data to manage the situation and mitigate its impact on our people.
# My number one goal from day one of this pandemic has always been to protect the integrity of our health care system. The current phase of the pandemic seems more and more like a "pandemic of the unvaccinated" - as the Delta variant has had very few breakthrough cases amongst those who have "gotten the shot" - but the goal remains the same: ensure everyone that can get better with quality care receives that quality care!
# Total hospitalizations remain below where they were at our peak from August of 2020. Total number of patients in ICU beds remains at or near our peak levels from August of 2020.
# Honestly, the real challenge is NOT the physical beds - hospital beds or ICU beds. The challenge is our hospitals may not have an adequate number of health care professionals (docs, nurses, respiratory therapists, etc.) to staff those beds. Unfortunately, I've been advised hospitals throughout Mississippi have lost nearly 2,000 nurses over the last year. There is a labor shortage in most industries throughout America today and health care is no different. Some hospitals lost staff because they laid off employees that never came back. Some staff left due to administrative decisions (such as mandating vaccines). But the reason for the shortage can be debated in the future.....the task at hand is to help backfill these vacancies to protect the integrity of our healthcare system.
